# Digits-Prediction-Clustering-with-Support-Vector-Machine
This is a basic Support Vector Machine example.
We used load_digits dataset from sklearn library.
We can also use SVM Algorithm for clustering data.
This program also can using for clustering. We can visualize clustering with matplotlib library.
